    <h1>An Open Platform for National Electricity Market Data</h1>

    <section style="max-width: 700px;">
      <p>
        The OpenNEM project aims to make the wealth of public National Electricity Market (NEM) 
        data more accessible to a wider audience.</p> 
      <p>
        We hope that improved access will facilitate better public understanding of the market, 
        improve energy literacy and help facilitate a more informed national discussion on Australiaâ€™s 
        energy transition in the long term interests of consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
        By providing a clear window on the data, we hope to address the information asymmetry between 
        stakeholders and improve the productivity of those engaged in energy market discussions.
